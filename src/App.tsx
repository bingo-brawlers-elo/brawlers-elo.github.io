        <p>
        This shows the elo ratings based on the matches listed above. They're <a href={'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12mc-zRMfN1GbnATjUiZJ_BN8M7V1E2kHiHn0EMHvrCQ/edit#gid=1099556932'}>  pulled from this sheet</a>,
        which was mostly aggregated by <em>Helios:23.5 Kenneth:5.5</em> on discord (thanks).
        The more matches, the more "accurate" the number would be.
        </p>
        <p>It's all just in good fun, and not supposed to be very serious. I made it because I was curious to see what the spread looked like. If you've got ideas and time, <a href={'https://github.com/bingo-brawlers-elo/brawlers-elo.github.io'} >send patches</a> â™¥</p>
